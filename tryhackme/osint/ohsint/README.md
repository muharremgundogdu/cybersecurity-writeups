# TryHackMe – OHSINT (OSINT Room)

## 🎯 Objective
This write-up documents my learning process while solving the OHSINT room on TryHackMe.
The focus is on **OSINT methodology and investigation flow**, not on sharing direct answers.

## 🧠 Investigation Flow
- Initial analysis started with the provided image
- Metadata was examined to extract potential technical and contextual clues
- Extracted identifiers were used to pivot into open-source platforms
- Multiple public sources were correlated to validate findings
- Each step built upon the previous clue in a structured OSINT chain

## 🛠 Tools & Techniques
- Metadata analysis tools
- Open-source search engines
- Social media and username correlation
- Wireless / SSID-related OSINT services
- Source code inspection for hidden clues

## 📌 Key Takeaways
- Small metadata details can lead to significant intelligence
- OSINT investigations require patience and systematic thinking
- Publicly shared information across platforms can be correlated easily
- Verification across multiple sources is c
