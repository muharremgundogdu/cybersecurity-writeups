# OSINT Methodology Notes

## 1. Start with what you have
Always begin with the initial artifact (image, username, email, domain, etc.)
and extract as much passive information as possible.

## 2. Pivot carefully
Use each discovered clue to pivot into another open-source platform.
Avoid random searching; follow a clear hypothesis.

## 3. Cross-check everything
Never rely on a single source. Validate findings using multiple platforms
and prefer primary sources when possible.

## 4. Stay passive & within scope
Focus on publicly available information. Avoid actions that require access,
authentication, or could be intrusive.

## 5. Document as you go
Record what you found, where you found it (source), and when.
Mark confidence level (confirmed / likely / unverified).

## 6. Think like an analyst
Focus on how information connects, and explain *why* each clue mattered.
