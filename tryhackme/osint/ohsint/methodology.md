# OSINT Methodology Notes

## 1. Start with what you have
Always begin with the initial artifact (image, username, email, etc.)
and extract as much passive information as possible.

## 2. Pivot carefully
Use each discovered clue to pivot into another open-source platform.
Avoid random searching.

## 3. Cross-check everything
Never rely on a single source. Validate findings using multiple platforms.

## 4. Think like an analyst
Focus on how information connects rather than rushing to conclusions.
